# Baseline Paper Retrospective Study 2022 Code Repository

This code repository contains the R code and intermediate analysis used to report the computational results for the paper: 

Zhang, A. et al. A retrospective observational study of law enforcement encounters for opioid-related overdoses and future arrests, incarceration, and overdoses: highlighting the need to break the vicious cycle. (2022)

Baseline_Paper_Analysis_Code.Rmd is the R file used to run the analysis. It generated the following three excel files:
* Table1_Demographics_All.xlsx
* Table2_BaselineStatistics_Group1.xlsx
* Table3_BaselineStatistics_Group2.xlsx
The VBACodeforTables.txt file was used to reformat the three excel files into an alternative format that more closely resembles how the tables are reported in the published paper. 

Since the input data files are not able to be stored here, the html file, Baseline_Paper_Analysis_Code.nb.html, shows the generated statistical tests completed by the r code, that is then reported in the paper. 

If you have any questions regarding the analysis conducted, please reach out to Veronica White at vmwhite@wisc.edu.
